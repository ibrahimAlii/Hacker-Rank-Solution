/*
You are given  queries. Each query consists of a single number . You can perform any of the  operations on  in each move:

1: If we take 2 integers  and  where , , then we can change

2: Decrease the value of  by .

Determine the minimum number of moves required to reduce the value of  to .

Input Format

The first line contains the integer .
The next  lines each contain an integer, .

Constraints



Output Format

Output  lines. Each line containing the minimum number of moves required to reduce the value of  to .

Sample Input

2
3
4
Sample Output

3
3
Explanation

For test case 1, We only have one option that gives the minimum number of moves.
Follow  ->  ->  -> . Hence,  moves.

For the case 2, we can either go  ->  ->  ->  ->  or  ->  ->  -> . The 2nd option is more optimal. Hence,  moves.
