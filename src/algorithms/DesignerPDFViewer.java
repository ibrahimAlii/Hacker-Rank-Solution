 When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. For example:

PDF-highighting.png

In this challenge, you will be given a list of letter heights in the alphabet and a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in  assuming all letters are  wide.

For example, the highlighted . Assume the heights of the letters are  and . The tallest letter is  high and there are  letters. The hightlighted area will be  so the answer is .
